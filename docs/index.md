# Some Video SDK

The documentation of this SDK is handled by an independent MkDocs project, and the API reference is generated by Doxygen.

This is version 0.3, but the documentation is almost the same as version 0.2. In general, this should not happen because a minor version bump should mean some non-breaking changes. However, this is just an example, so whatever.

The pros and cons of this approach (how we handle the documentation) listed below.

### Pros

In progress.

### Cons

In progress.
